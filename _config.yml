intro: |
  Having been a professional musician all my adult life, with a Ph.D. in music, I began pivoting to a career in coding in 2015. I had first become hooked on programming in 1996, when, several years after getting my bachelor's degree in composition, I completed a 13-month course in C and COBOL at Computer Learning Center, San Francisco. I was accepted into the doctoral program in music while taking this course, and so I postponed working in tech, but wrote programs (such as a metronome app) for my own use. I also worked in the Max/MSP language for multimedia control and sound generation at the Center for New Music and Audio Technologies (CNMAT) at Berkeley.<br/><br/>
  I focused intensely on music for the next 10 years, but, gradually, the itch to work in tech returned, and I began experimenting with Python/Django, the MEAN stack, Ruby, and web development; I also got up to speed with OOP. I completed the C#/.NET Full-Stack Developer program at Austin Coding Academy in 2018, and began tutoring for ACA halfway through the course. I continued to work for the school after graduating, writing and editing textbooks for classes in ASP.NET Core REST APIs, WordPress, JavaScript, and web basics.<br/><br/>
  I'm now a Jr. Dev, working on a proprietary investment management system for a firm specializing in alternative investments. The system facilitates and tracks all accounting activity and documentation for the participating investors, funds, and holding companies. It provides tools for calculating fund distributions, reinvestments, and returns, along with reporting and data management capabilities.<br/><br/>

#    <strong>Web Development</strong>: Through building web applications, I have also worked with various client side technology, having used jQuery, Bootstrap, LESS, SASS, Backbone/Underscore/Require. More recently I have written React applications (primarily using the Create React App framework, and extending them)<br/><br/>
#    <strong>Development Control</strong>: I have a good knowledge of application life-cycle management and have worked with SVN, Git, Maven, Gradle, Sonar, Jenkins, TeamCity, etc. I have experience with an array of testing tools and technologies.<br/><br/>
#    I have also gained experience and knowledge of other technologies from several side projects and research that I have undertaken in my free time, including Android, a variety of social APIs (Twitter etc) and cloud platforms such as CloudFoundry/OpenShift/AppFog/AWS. <br/><br/>
#    As part of Nerdability, I created, and am now primary contributor to, two Spring projects - <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/robhinds/spring-social-geeklist">Spring-Social-Geeklist</a> and <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/nerdability/spring-social-khan-academy">Spring-Social-Khan-Academy</a>, which provide core integration with those third-party APIs on top of the Spring Social framework. They are both listed as community projects: <a target='_blank' href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-social/">http://projects.spring.io/spring-social/</a>. <br/><br/>
