intro: |
  I am a lifelong professional musician, working for the past several years toward a second career in software development, which, like music composition, is about design of structures and integration of components. And it is also a long-term passion of mine, although making it my career has come later in life. I am a graduate of Austin Coding Academy's .NET Full-Stack Developer program, and am currently employed by the school to help develop its .NET curriculum.<br/><br/>
  I have worked with a broad variety of technologies and languages going back to the 1990s, with studies of COBOL and C at San Francisco's Computer Learning Center. I have built applications on a wide variety of platforms, from a metronome app for Palm Pilot (2003) to MVC and single-page web applications using .NET Core and the MEAN stack. I am a fanatic about optimal design and clean and efficient code.

#    <strong>Scala</strong>: My current role uses Scala as the primary language and have been building applications in Scala for the last two years. I am familiar with a range of Scala libraries, such as <a target="_blank" href="http://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/2017/12/an-opinionated-guide-to-building-apis.html"> Akka-Http for building microservices</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/2018/09/generic-programming-with-scala.html"> Shapeless for generic programming</a>, as well as familiar with a range of <a target="_blank" href="https://basementcrowd.com/2018/11/28/scala-the-aux-pattern-path-dependent-types/" >functional programming techniques available</a>.<br/><br/>
#    <strong>Java</strong>: I am experienced in a variety of Java APIâ€™s and frameworks. I have worked with Spring 4, Spring Boot, JPA (Hibernate and EclipseLink) in addition to others. <br/><br/>
#    <strong>Groovy</strong> I have used Groovy as a language in production for ~4 years and I am familiar with many of the languages features (such as writing <a target='_blank' href="https://dzone.com/articles/functional-programming-groovy">Functional Programming style groovy</a>) and quirks (such as <a target="_blank" href="https://dzone.com/articles/groovy-retrospective-an-addendum-memory-usage-perm">memory leak issues</a>). <br/><br/>
#    <strong>Cloud platforms</strong>: I have primarily used AWS for running production apps on the cloud. I have experience setting up, configuring and running applications using a range of AWS offerings, including EC2, RDS, S3, Cogito, <a target="_blank" href="http://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/2018/05/serverless-with-aws-lambda-scala.html">Lambda</a> and its more recent <a target="_blank" href="http://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/2018/10/machine-learning-with-aws-scala.html">Machine Learning capabilities</a>.<br/><br/>
#    <strong>Web Development</strong>: Through building web applications, I have also worked with various client side technology, having used jQuery, Bootstrap, LESS, SASS, Backbone/Underscore/Require. More recently I have written React applications (primarily using the Create React App framework, and extending them)<br/><br/>
#    <strong>Development Control</strong>: I have a good knowledge of application life-cycle management and have worked with SVN, Git, Maven, Gradle, Sonar, Jenkins, TeamCity, etc. I have experience with an array of testing tools and technologies.<br/><br/>
#    I have also gained experience and knowledge of other technologies from several side projects and research that I have undertaken in my free time, including Android, a variety of social APIs (Twitter etc) and cloud platforms such as CloudFoundry/OpenShift/AppFog/AWS. <br/><br/>
#    As part of Nerdability, I created, and am now primary contributor to, two Spring projects - <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/robhinds/spring-social-geeklist">Spring-Social-Geeklist</a> and <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/nerdability/spring-social-khan-academy">Spring-Social-Khan-Academy</a>, which provide core integration with those third-party APIs on top of the Spring Social framework. They are both listed as community projects: <a target='_blank' href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-social/">http://projects.spring.io/spring-social/</a>. <br/><br/>
#    I write a blog covering technical and opinion articles that can be found here: <a target='_blank' href="http://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/">automateddeveloper.blogspot.com</a> (I am also a <a target='_blank' href="https://dzone.com/users/899489/rhinds.html">DZone MVB</a>)
